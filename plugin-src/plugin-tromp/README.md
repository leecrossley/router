## Tromp Plugin

### Make Android Great Again!

This plugin is responsible for Android FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) updates and is implemented entirely in Java, with corresponding activities.

It has no JavaScript component but is structured as a Cordova plugin for easy install and verification (and also in case there is a JS component in the future).
